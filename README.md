# NZ Veterinary Locum Network - Frontend

<h4>About This Project</h4>

  In order to market themselves and look for jobs, there hasn't been a website created exclusively for veterinary locums in New Zealand. 
  <br></br>
  This project intends to develop a platform where veterinary locums can create profiles and introduce themselves and companies can post job vacancies for locums.
We resolve the current communication issue by facilitating direct communication between veterinarian offices and locum tenens.

<h4>Why is this problem valuable to address?</h4>

There is still no infrastructure that enables veterinary locums to openly promote themselves outside of a recruitment agency, 
making it very difficult for locums and clinics to connect without third-party intervention (recruitment agency). 
If new veterinary locums don't already have personal relationships with clinics, finding one can be very challenging. 
They have no platform to view and identify the clinics that require them. Currently, a Facebook group is the only location locums may access information. 
My aim is to have all doctors' information in a beautiful, 
understandable style so that they don't have to wade through several Facebook postings to figure out which locum is reliable and reachable for a clinic.

<h4>Goals</h4>
With this project, I intend to make it easier for veterinary clinics and locums to organize employment on their own without the use 
of a recruitment firm by centralizing lists of available jobs and veterinary locums.
The NZ Veterinary Locum Network will be the only platform to keep track of veterinary locum's profiles that are visible to the public online, 
filling a specialized need for a distinct sector on the website rather than specialized Facebook groups.

### Bug / Feature Request
- Known limitations as for now is, when you register a user an uploaded image that's larger than 1mb, it will continuously stay in the loading page, this is because the SSL certificate from the cloud server doesn't allow large file to be send. On console log it will show that it's a CORS issue.
If you discover more bug (the website was unable to process the query and/or returned undesirable results), kindly open an issue [here](https://github.com/applescan/NZ-Veterinary-Locum-CapstoneProject/issues/new) by mentioning your search term and the desired outcome.
